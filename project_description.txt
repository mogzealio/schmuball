In SchmuBall, the player controls a cat that appears at the bottom centre of
screen. The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and
shoot furballs using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens
fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and
destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears
that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player's cat
or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a cat-life. If the player
loses 9 ships, the game ends.
